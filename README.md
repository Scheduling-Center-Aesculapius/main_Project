# 👩🏻‍⚕️ Aesculapius Scheduling Center 👩🏻‍⚕️

Team Orange is now developing the final version of the Entra21 project. You can check the prototype The initiative is to facilitate the scheduling of medical appointments with professionals from different areas of health. There are initially three profiles, the Patient, the Doctor - which can be any healthcare professional - and the Admin. To use the program, simply register, informing common data such as name, CPF (for the health professional, the CRM, CRE, CRO or CRP number for example), address for example. Patients will be able to search for which doctor will be available at the time they need it, they will be able to see their own appointments, change their dates and times, change professionals or even cancel an appointment. The doctor, on the other hand, will be able to share available times and days for patient care, view their appointments for the day and cancel a pre-booked appointment.

One of the most important parts of developing, its prototype the system, because it makes the process of structuring the application a lot easier when comes about designing the screens. Thinking about it, Orange Team took some hours and a lot of imagination to desing the system layout. We used Figma for this. Here is the preview :

<summary>4th step : Front end 🎨</summary>
Basing our concepts on the best practices of the front end developing, we are using Angular, a typescript framework, developed by Google. Angular is a framework based on the component concept. Each part of the code can be a component, with their own logic and peculiarities. We organized the components based on the user access. We have the components to the patient, the professional and the admin.
Each one has their own services and models, that comunicate with the back end , sending  the requests.
